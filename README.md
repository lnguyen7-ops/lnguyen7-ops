### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist and former chemist. I have a passion about problem-solving, regardless of the topic is chemistry related or not. I really enjoy learning new data science concepts and programming concepts during my free time. My hobby is solving coding puzzles, working on personal data projects and watching American football (<span style="color:red;"><b>Go Chiefs !</b></span>).
